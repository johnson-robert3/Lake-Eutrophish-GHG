# 2020 Hort Farm Pond Experiment

Greenhouse Gas Dynamics in Shallow Aquatic Ecosystems in Response to a Pulse Nutrient Addition


### Next Steps / To Do 

- Investigate times when thermocline depth is within 0.5m of the top or bottom. Are there many of these?
  - What about thermocline within 0.3m?
- Change thermo depth to 1.75m when the estimate is close to the top or bottom 
- Investigate large, rapid drops in pond DO concentration
  - Do they follow a consistent shape or response curve?
- Write a function to remove (and interpolate) these drops in DO
